		  <h2>My Journey to become a web developer:</h2>
		  <P>Talking about this new journey in web development it has been an eye-opening experience for me. I was always looking for good opportunity to learn some IT courses from good platform and now I found Correlation 
			One is a platform that i was searching for.Before joining in Correlation One I never had taken any IT courses so I had zero experiene in IT but I was always 
			interested in IT. After joining this program I have learned alot and now  I made this site. I have used the different html skills to make this site. Talking abou the skills that I have learned so far are I get know about
			what is html, differet parts of web, table, form, embeding images, audio and much more. To make this site I have used different element with different types
			of attributes such as paragraph, heading, section, form, styples, images, favicon, header, foooter, main and etc. I feel that I have learned alot within two 
			weeks and much more is on the way to know. I am very excited to learn more to become a good web developer. I am very thankful to Correlation One platform for teaching 
			me such a good course.</P>
